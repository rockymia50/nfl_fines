    "Biography": "Jacob Ford (born July 20, 1983 in Memphis, Tennessee ) is a former American football defensive end . He was originally selected by the Tennessee Titans as the 204th overall pick in the 6th round of the 2007 NFL Draft . He played college football at Central Arkansas . PRO: Now in his fifth NFL season, former sixth-round draft pick Jacob Ford is one of the most established pass rushers on the squad. From 2008 through 2010, no other Titans defender had more than Ford’s 15.5 total sacks. The athletically-gifted Ford was one of the fastest defensive ends available in the 2007 rookie pool, but his talents were only briefly on display for the Titans before a left Achilles’ injury in his first training camp resulted in his placement on injured reserve. He returned from the injury in 2008 to post seven sacks and followed that with a team-high 5.5 sacks in 2009 and three sacks in 2010.",
